## Information

Some info about the OWASP Foundation, the OWASP Top Ten and the Juice Shop project

### OWASP
![OWASP Logo](/assets/images/OWASP_Logo.png)

The Open Web Application Security ProjectÂ® [(OWASP)](https://owasp.org) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.
Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

### OWASP Top Ten

The [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.
It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
Globally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding.
Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks.
Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.

### OWASP Juice Shop
![Juice Shop Logo](/assets/images/JuiceShop_Logo_100px.png)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!
